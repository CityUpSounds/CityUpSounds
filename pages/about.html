<h1>About</h1>
<p>Thankyou for visiting my site. I have been blown away by the supportive feedback and reactions I have received.</p>
<p>This site was started basically to share my passion of sounds and recordings with an entire world of people whom share a similar interest.</p>
<p>My interests initially began mid 2016(ish) with my first sound effects recordings. Recorded only with the smartphone I had at the time, you would appreciate the quality was fairly raw, but was exactly enough to spark the passion I share with so many others today. Along the way I have improved my recording equipment so as to capture a more detailed sound quality. Now as my collection of recordings grows, I share them with you.</p>
<p>I hope to continue to grow both this site and my collection of recordings, while sharing my passion for sound.</p>

<h2>Images, Video and Audio</h2>
<p>I physicially take the photos, capture the video and record the audio myself. Yep. The images used on this website <i>(exceptions noted below), </i>the video embeded and the audio have been taken by me using my camera / recording equipment. I feel the images and video, just like the sound recordings, are an important part of the experience to help reflect that time; that place.</p>
<p>I try to capture images which reflect the emotions of the location and in a way, the emotions of the day, whether be dark or joyfull. </p>
<p class="about_indent">PNG - Mostly edited using GIMP.</p>
<p class="about_indent">SVG - Mostly edited using SVG-Edit.</p>
<p class="about_indent">MP4 - Edited using Shotcut.</p>
<p class="about_indent">WAV and MP3 - Mostly edited using Audacity</p>

<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>This site has been built by myself. I scripted the site based on HTML, CSS and Python. I specifically chose not to include JavaScript in my coding but JavaScript is used via third party scripts e.g. Google Analytics. Flexbox in the CSS allows the site to be repsonsive / mobile friendly.</p>
<p>Scripting software used is Visual Studio Code</p>
<p>Building this site myself has allowed me the opportunitity to learn many concepts of HTML, CSS and Python. Influences and guidance has mostly come from YouTube, web searches, trial and error. I am comfortable acknowledging there shall be errors in this site or that the script could have been   written more efficient. Thats part of the learning experience. Maybe one day I may rebuild the site from scratch again with an improved style... Maybe?</p>
